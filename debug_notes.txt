Cloudinary "Unknown API Key" error ka matlab:

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` environment variable is either:
1. Not yet loaded (Vercel deploy still in progress)
2. Has wrong value

From user's Cloudinary screenshot: Cloud Name = `delday2pi`

The URL being called would be: `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/undefined/image/upload`
if env var is not loaded yet.

Solution: Hardcode cloud name temporarily to test, or wait for Vercel redeploy.
