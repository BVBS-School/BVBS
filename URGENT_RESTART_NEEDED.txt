STOP AND RESTART THE SERVER.

Refer to the error you sent: "MulterError: Unexpected field".
This error happens because the code running on your server is 25 HOURS OLD.
It does not have the fix I pushed an hour ago.

You must do this MANUALLY in your terminal:
1. Click on the terminal where `node src/index.js` is running.
2. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it.
3. Type `node src/index.js` and press Enter to start it again.

Only AFTER you do this, the error will disappear.
I cannot do this for you because the server was started before I connected.
